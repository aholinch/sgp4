Thank you to everyone with ideas and suggestions on improving this project, but I won't be accepting pull requests.  The license is not a good one for protecting collaborative work.

Sorry, but the license for this project is the "Unlicense" and it does not provide any protection for contributors. You deserve credit and protection for the work you do, but this license won't provide that. I chose this license because I do not own the original code. The original authors who published it did so by fixing several problems in a US Government standard. They also provided amazing test cases to demonstrate their fixes. My unique contributions are porting the code to multiple languages including support for running their test cases. If you want to make changes, feel free to fork the project and put your own license on it. However, this project is not setup for collaboration.
